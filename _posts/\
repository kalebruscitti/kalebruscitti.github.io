Given an arbitrary real number x, what is required to write an exact expression for x? If x is an integer, then we have symbols to write it out explicitly. For other numbers, it might suffice to write them as a fraction, or with a square root symbol. Of course, there are also numbers who cannot be written explicitly with a finite number of symbols - $\pi$ would be one such number, if we didn't cheat by giving it a symbol of its' own. While learning Galois theory, I noticed a connection between the radicals required to write an algebraic number, and the structure of the corresponding Galois group, the Galois group of the number's minimal polynomial's splitting field. A very lazy google search did not reveal a proof of this connection, so I wrote one.

Theorem:
If $\alpha$ is an algebraic number, then the minimum number of radicals
required to represent $\alpha$ is equal to the number of subgroups in
the abelian tower of the galois group of $\alpha$’s minimal polynomial.

Proof (by induction):

For the base case, we let $n=0$, i.e. $\alpha$ takes 0 radicals to
write, which means that $\alpha \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then the minimal
polynomial is $x - \alpha = 0$, which has $\alpha$ as a root, and the
Galois group is trivial. Then the number of subgroups in the Abelian
tower is zero.

For the inductive step, let $\alpha$ be an algebraic number which takes
$n$ radicals to write. Then we can write
$$\alpha = a (\beta)^{1/k} + b$$ for some $\beta$ which takes $n-1$ many
radicals to write. Suppose by our hypothesis that the Galois group of
$\beta$’s minimal polynomial $m_\beta (x)$ has $n-1$ many subgroups in
it’s Abelian tower. We want to show that $\alpha$ has $n$ many subgroups
in it’s Abelian tower.

Let $K$ be the splitting field of $m_\beta (x)$. We can construct the
minimal polynomial $m_\alpha (x)$ of $\alpha$ in $K$ as
$\frac{1}{a}(\alpha - b)^k = 0$, and then construct the splitting field
$K'$ of $\alpha \in K$. Since $\alpha$ is constructable, the Galois group $G_{K'}$ of $K'$ must have an abelian tower, and since each solvable Galois
group has only one tower, we know that the tower of length $n-1$ for
$\beta$ in $G_K$ is included as a subset if $G_K$ is a normal subgroup of $G_{K'}$. Thus if we can prove that $G_K \trianglelefteq G_{K'}$,
that will be the $n$th group in the Abelian tower, and we will be done.\
However, $K$ was the splitting field of $m_\beta (x)$, and hence is a
normal extension of $Q$. By the fundamental theorem of Galois theory,
this means that $K$ is a normal subgroup of $K'$ as required.

Then the result follows from the principle of mathematical induction.
