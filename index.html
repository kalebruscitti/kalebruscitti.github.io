      Hello,
      <br><br>
      I am currently a PhD student at the University of Waterloo in the Department of Pure Mathematics, working under the co-supervision of Elana Kalashnikov and Ruxandra Moraru.
      <br><br>
      My research interest is applications of algebraic geometry, particularly to statistics, cryptography, and
      computer science. Many objects of study in these areas can be modeled by algebraic or analytic spaces with
      some group symmetries, and so the methods of equivariant geometry can be brought to bear on them. Currently,
      I am focusing on <i> singular learning theory </i>, a branch of statistical learning theory and information
      geometry that handles statistical models which cannot be modelled as a smooth manifold with
      positive-definition Fisher information metric. To see more detail about my past research projects, check
      out the links in the side bar.
	  <br><br>
	  Outside of research, I have broad interests in many topics. I love music and dance; I collect musical instruments (most of which I play quite poorly) and practice many styles of dance such as ballroom, swing, disco and hip-hop. I also find history and social anthropology fascinating. At the time of writing, I have been spending a lot of time reading about the 1900s, especially labour history and conflicts and how the aftermath of the wars of the last century affect us today.
