      Welcome,
      <br><br>
      This is my narcissistic website about myself. If you want to know about me on a professional level, I encourage you to browse the links on the side and bottom of this page.
      <br><br>
      On a personal level, I can tell you that I love mathematics, both pure and applied, I love physics and the inherent beauty in nature, and most of all I love to dance. I spend most of my free time doing one of those three things, but I also enjoy literature and I'm trying to learn to play piano.
      <br><br>
      If you still want to know more, feel free to contact me at kaleb.ruscitti@uwaterloo.ca or one of the social media profiles linked.
