      Hello,
      <br><br>
      I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, majoring in
      Mathematical Physics and minoring in Pure Math, and a student researcher at the Institute for Quantum Computing.
      <br><br>
      My research interests are in Quantum Information and Computing, as well as Geometry and Topology and their applications in physics.
