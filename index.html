      Welcome to my website/online CV,
      <br><br>
      If you want to know about my academic achievements, I encourage you to browse the links on the side and bottom of this page.
      I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, studying Mathematical Physics and Pure Math, and a student researcher at the Institute for Quantum Computing.
      <br><br>
      Aside from academics, I enjoy ballroom dancing, and I am an avid student of foreign languages. 我的中文名字是段承宇。
      I did hair modelling for about a year in high school, so I guess that can go on my CV as well.
      <br><br>
      If you still want to know more, feel free to contact me via kaleb.ruscitti at uwaterloo.ca or one of the social media profiles linked.
