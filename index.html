      Hello,
      <br><br>
      I am currently a PhD student at the University of Waterloo in the Department of Pure Mathematics, working under the co-supervision of Elana Kalashnikov and Ruxandra Moraru.
      <br><br>
      My research interests, in order, are:
      <ol>
        <li> Singular statistical learning theory </li>
        <li> Moduli stack approaches to statistical modelling </li>
        <li> Machine learning interpretability and safety </li>
        <li> Geometric and topological data science </li>
      </ol>
      These areas all use the fundamental concept of geometric <i>equivariance</i>. My goal is to apply
      the pure mathematical tools developed in equivariant algebraic and differential geometry to real-world problems 
      through statistical modelling and data science. To see more detail about my past research projects, check
      out the links in the side bar.
	  <br><br>
	  Outside of research, I have broad interests in many topics. I love music and dance; 
    I collect musical instruments (most of which I play quite poorly) and practice many styles of dance such as ballroom, 
    swing, disco and hip-hop. I also find history and social anthropology fascinating.
    At the time of writing, I have been spending a lot of time reading about the 1900s, especially labour history and conflicts 
    and how the aftermath of the wars of the last century affect us today. I have been learning French and Mandarin for years, and 
    can speak, read and write in both languages at an intermediate level.
