  <h1> Pok&eacute;Map </h1>
  <h3> A datamap of all 1025 pok&eacute;mon,
    clustered by type, abilities and moves.
  </h3>
  <p> Data obtained from
  <a href="https://pokeapi.co/"> PokeAPI </a>. <br>
  To search for a specific move or ability, remove spaces.
  E.g. "Grass Knot" -> "grassknot". <br> To search for a type
  but exclude moves with that substring, add a space. E.g. to
  search "Fire" and exclude "Fire Blast", search for "fire "

  <p> Some notes: <br>
  1. Move data is taken across all generations, so
  a move is included for a pokemon if it learned it at
  any point. <br>
  2. Cluster labels were made by manually eyeballing the 'mons in a
  cluster and picking a fitting word. <br>
  <br>
  The visualization was made with
  <a href="https://github.com/TutteInstitute/datamapplot">
    datamapplot</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap"> UMAP</a>,
  and the python library
