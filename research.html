  <h3>Adaptive Optics for Addressing Ions in an Ion Trap.</h3>
  <a href="">Details</a>
  <p>We implement adaptive optics in a laboratory setting with the goal of gaining optical abberation correction and detailed, in-situ and real-time addressing of ions in a Yb+ ion trap. In particular, I am working on increasing the power efficiency of the method.</p>
