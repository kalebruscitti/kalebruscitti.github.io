  <h3>Phase sensitive electric field detection using a mechanical microwave mixer.</h3>
  <p> Developed a method for make phase sensitive, contactless measurements of electric fields using a mechanical cantilever as a microwave mixer. I demonstrated that the technique works for RF fields up to 3+ GHz. </p> 
  <p> This project was done under the supervision of Prof. Raffi Budakian. </p>

  <h3>Adaptive optics for addressing ions in an ion trap.</h3>
  <a href="">Details</a>
  <p>Implemented adaptive optics in the laboratory with the goal of gaining optical abberation correction and detailed, in-situ and real-time addressing of ions in a Yb+ ion trap. I handled the implementation details, from designing the optics to writing the software to control the setup. </p>
  <p>This work was used in <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Session/M01.159">Engineering programmable spin interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator with holographic single-ion addressing</a>

  <h3>pySLM: Python Spatial Light Modulation </h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/QITI/pySLM">Github</a>  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyslm">PyPI</a>
  <p>A python package for controlling spatial light modulators, such as LCD adaptive optics or Digital Micromirror devices. Co-authored by myself and <a href="https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/people/profile/c5shih/">Gilbert Shih</a>.</p>
