<h2 id="battlecard-galactica">Battlecard Galactica</h2>
<p>Battlecard Galactica is a turn-based strategy board game, crossed with a deck-builder card game.</p>
<p><img src="https://kaleb.ruscitti.ca/images/bcggameplay.png" width=960></p>
<p>Inspired by Star Realms, Slay the Spire and Civilization, Battlecard Galactica aims to take the joy of building up a delicious combo in your deck, and mix it with a strategy game that is more complex then Star Realms, but can be completed much faster than a game of Civilization.</p>
<p>The game is programmed in Godot 4, entirely by myself and with the help of many online tutorials. The art for all the pieces and cards was also done by myself, and the audio is all placeholders taken from royalty-free sites.</p>
