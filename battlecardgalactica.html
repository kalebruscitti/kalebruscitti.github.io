    <p>Inspired by Star Realms, Slay the Spire and Civilization, Battlecard
    Galactica aims to take the joy of building up a delicious combo in your deck,
    and mix it with a strategy game that is more complex then Star Realms, but can
    be completed much faster than a game of Civilization.</p>
    <p> It is a multiplayer, PvP turn-based strategy game for 2 players. Every
    turn in the build phase, play cards from your deck to build up your empire
    and fleet, then engage the enemy in combat during the move phase. Building
    up your economy lets you purchase new cards to build up your deck, but only
    if your opponent doesn't get to them first!</p>
    <p>The game is programmed in Godot 4, entirely by myself and with the help of
    many online tutorials. The art for all the pieces and cards was also done by
    myself, and the audio is all placeholders taken from royalty-free sites.</p>
