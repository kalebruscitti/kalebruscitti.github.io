      <p>Battlecard Galactica is a turn-based strategy board game combined with a
      deck-builder card game.</p>

    <p>Inspired by Star Realms, Slay the Spire, and Civilization, 
      Battlecard Galactica aims to take the joy of developing a power combo deck,
      and combine it with a strategy game that is deeper than Star Realms,
      but which can be completed much faster than a game of Civilization.</p>
    <p> It is a mutiplayer PvP turn-based strategy game for 2-4 players.
     Play cards from your deck to build up your empire and fleet during,
     then engage the enemy in combat to conquer valuable planets and
     ultimately the galaxy. Building up your economy lets you add new 
     cards to your deck, but only if your opponent doesn't get them first!</p>
    <p>This was entirely a hobby project, made entirely by me, 
    in the Godot 4 engine, with the help of many tutorials. 
    All the art and assets were also made by me, with the exception of 
    the audio which is all taken from royalty-free sites.</p>
    <p> The game is currently in a playable alpha state, and is unlikely to ever leave alpha.</p>
